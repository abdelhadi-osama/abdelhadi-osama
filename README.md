🚀 Autonomous Systems Engineer
Robotics · AI/ML · Control · Embedded Systems

I build reliable autonomous systems that solve real-world problems —
from embedded control and perception to AI-driven decision-making in complex environments.

My work sits at the intersection of robotics, AI/ML, control theory, and embedded systems, with a strong focus on clean architecture, solid pipelines, and real deployment readiness.

🧠 Core Focus

Autonomous systems (UAVs, multi-agent, real-world constraints)

Robotics & simulation-first development

AI / ML & Deep Learning (from scratch → production)

Control systems integrated with embedded hardware

End-to-end system pipelines (data → model → deployment)

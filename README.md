# 🚀 Autonomous Systems Engineer | Robotics · AI/ML · Control

I build reliable autonomous systems that solve real-world problems — from embedded control and perception to AI-driven decision making in complex environments.

My work sits at the intersection of robotics, AI/ML, control theory, and embedded systems, with a strong focus on clean architecture, solid pipelines, and real deployment readiness.

## 📌 Selected Projects

### 🔹 CMAPSS Jet Engine Failure Prediction (Production-Ready ML)
Linear Regression–based predictive system for estimating failure time in simulated jet engines.

**Pipeline (end-to-end):**  
Data Upload → EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Hyperparameter Tuning → Evaluation → Deployment

* Real production-style ML pipeline (not just training a model)
* Interactive Gradio UI
* Final accuracy: ~87%
* Strong emphasis on reliability and evaluation

### 🔹 AutoML Trainer (Generic ML Pipeline System)
A fully automated ML training system that accepts datasets via UI and handles the full lifecycle:
* EDA & preprocessing
* Model selection & training
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Supports regression & classification
* Downloadable trained models & processed datasets

*Focused on system generality, not one-off experiments.*

### 🔹 Neural Network Framework From Scratch (NumPy Only)
Built a complete neural network framework without any ML libraries.

**Two phases:**
1. **Core NN library:** Layers, activations, loss functions, Backpropagation, Optimization logic.
2. **Production-style DL pipeline** using the framework.

**Applied to:**
* Breast cancer classification
* MNIST digit recognition

*Goal: Deep understanding of math, stability, and architecture, not black-box usage.*

### 🔹 TEKNOFEST – Fighter UAV Stars Competition
Worked on autonomous UAV systems for air-to-air defense scenarios.

**Mission scope:**
* Autonomous takeoff
* Autonomous swarm flight
* Autonomous target destruction

**Focus:**
* Multi-agent autonomy
* Control + decision-making
* Realistic defense scenarios in controlled environments

## 🧩 Engineering Philosophy

* I prefer building from scratch over relying on opaque frameworks.
* I value clean architecture over fast hacks.
* I design solid pipelines, not isolated scripts.
* I focus on learning and correctness before shipping.
* I think in systems, not components.

---

## 📚 Current Direction

* Real-world autonomous robotics deployment.
* Multi-UAV coordination & spatial decision-making.
* Deep integration of: **Embedded Systems + Control Theory + AI**.
* Making autonomous systems act reliably in real environments.

---

## ⚡ Outside Code

* Research & deep reading.
* Engineering competitions and challenges.
* Stress-testing systems until they break — then fixing them properly.

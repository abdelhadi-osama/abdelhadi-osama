# 🚀 Autonomous Systems Engineer  
### Robotics · AI/ML · Control · Embedded Systems

I build **reliable autonomous systems** that solve real-world problems —  
from **embedded control and perception** to **AI-driven decision-making** in complex environments.

My work lies at the intersection of **autonomous systems, robotics, AI/ML, control theory, and embedded systems**, with a strong focus on **clean architecture, solid pipelines, and deployment-ready systems**.
